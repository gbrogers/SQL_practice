    -- Create a file called person.sql and write out the code for the following problems:

    -- Create a table called person that records a personâ€™s id, name, age, height ( in cm ), city, favorite_color.
CREATE TABLE person (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
  name VARCHAR(20),
  age INT, 
  height INT,
  city VARCHAR(20),
  favorite_color VARCHAR(20)
  );
    --         id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key - Use type: SERIAL

    -- Add 5 different people into the person database.
